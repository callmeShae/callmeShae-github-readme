👋 Hi, I’m Shannon Smith, but _almost_ everyone calls me Shae 😄 

I’m a Software Developer specializing in Java. Prior to discovering my programming skills, I spent a few years in the ⚓ U.S. Navy ⚓, but now enjoy my time outside of work by...

- 🎨 Working on art of any kind (painting, drawing, sculpture and woodworking)
- 🏠 Completing home renovation projects
- 🚴 Cycling
- 🐾 Spending time with my wife and pets!
- and of course, improving my Programming skills!
