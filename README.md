- 👋 Hi, I’m Shae. 
- 👀 I’m interested in different programming languages. I'm a beginner, but thankfully starting at Virginia Tech in the fall on a Masters Degree in Information Technology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and C++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything people are willing to include me on. I'm not sure how much I have to contribute this early on, but always willing to help if I can.
