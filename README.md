- 👋 Hi, I’m Shae. 
- 👀 I’m interested in different programming languages. I'm a beginner, but thankful to be in the MIT program at Virginia Tech. Also hoping to start the Hack Reactor Bootcamp through Galvanize next month.
- I'm currently learning JavaScript and Python. Will take a stab at C# once I feel comfortable with those.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything people are willing to include me on. I'm not sure how much I have to contribute this early on, but always willing to help if I can.
