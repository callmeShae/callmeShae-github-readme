👋 Hi, I’m Shannon Smith, but almost everyone calls me Shae. 

I’m a software developer specializing in Java. Prior to developing my programming skills, I spent a few years in the ⚓ U.S. Navy ⚓. Outside of work, I enjoy...

- 🎨 Working on art of any kind (painting, drawing, sculpture, woodworking)
- 🚴 Cycling
- 🐾 Spending time with the pets!
